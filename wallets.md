Digital wallets can help keep your digital currency safe, private and in your control. We highly recommend the use of wallets for storing Ergo assets (technically, they store the keys to your Ergo addresses). But keep in mind, your wallet is unlike your bank account, so take extra precautions with your passwords and be sure to perform regular backups to protect your money.

Note that wallets are supported by third parties, we only provide the information below as a courtesy, in order to simplify the overall digital currency experience for you.

Yoroi (on desktop) or a full node is the best solution at the moment. Mobile apps in development.
