# Appkit

Appkit has idiomatic Java API and is written in Java/Scala. It is a thin wrapper around core components provided by ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations which are written in Scala. It is [published](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.ergoplatform/ergo-appkit) on maven repository and cross compiled to both Java 7 and Java 8+ jars.

The Appkit library is compatible with GraalVM - a novel next generation approach to implement software which is reusable across several programming languages and execution environments. For example if Node.js application is run on GraalVM, then it can use Appkit to interact with Ergo Blockchain.

Using Appkit Ergo applications can be written in one of the languages supported by GraalVM (i.e. Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R) and using this library applications can communicate with Ergo nodes via unified API and programming model provided by Appkit. In addition Appkit based Ergo applications can be compiled into native code using native-image ahead of time compiler and then executed without Java VM with very fast startup time and lower runtime memory overhead compared to a Java VM. This is attractive option for high-performance low-latency microservices.

In addition Appkit is compatible with Android and can be used from Android applications.

## Rust
sigma-rust is an alternative and simple implementation of ErgoTree interpreter and transaction building tools. The goal for the Rust version is to be on par with Scala version feature-wise. Now Rust version is still significantly behind. Also the goal for the Rust version is to have bindings for web, iOS and Android. The Scala version will continue to be the primary choice for JVM ecosystem with Rust version covering the rest.

[sigma-rust](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust) - implementation of ErgoScript cryptocurrency scripting language. To get better understanding on how to use it in your project check out how its being used in the following projects:

- [Ergo Headless dApp Framework](https://github.com/Emurgo/ergo-headless-dapp-framework);
- [Ergo Node Interface Library](https://github.com/Emurgo/ergo-node-interface);
