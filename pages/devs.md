# Developers 

This page provides a curated page of resources for developers. Please submit a PR if anything is missing!

For most developers, [Appkit](#appkit) is the best entry point unless you're wanting to dive straight into [ErgoScript](#ergoscript).

## Other Pages

- See [wallets.md](/wallets.md) for developer resources within that area
- See [apps.md](/apps.md) for developer resources relating to Oracles, Ergo Auctions, SigmaUSD, or any existing applications built ontop Ergo.

## Hackathons

We've just completed our first hackathon -- [ErgoHack](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-06-19-ergohack/), but there's plenty more on the way.

- September (TBC)

# Software Development Kit
## Appkit

[Appkit: A Library for Polyglot Development of Ergo Applications](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit) has idiomatic Java API and is written in Java/Scala. It is a thin wrapper around core components provided by ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations which are written in Scala. It is published on [maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.ergoplatform/ergo-appkit)) and cross compiled to both Java 7 and Java 8+ jars.

[AppKit - Using from Java](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit#using-from-java) is the starting point most people will want if using Java.

The Appkit library is also compatible with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) - a novel next generation approach to implement software which is reusable across several programming languages and execution environments. For example if Node.js application is run on GraalVM, then it can use Appkit to interact with Ergo Blockchain.

Using Appkit Ergo applications can be written in one of the languages supported by GraalVM (i.e. Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R) and using this library applications can communicate with Ergo nodes via unified API and programming model provided by Appkit. In addition Appkit based Ergo applications can be compiled into native code using native-image ahead of time compiler and then executed without Java VM with very fast startup time and lower runtime memory overhead compared to a Java VM. This is attractive option for high-performance low-latency microservices.

# Sigma Language 

Bitcoin is a stack-based Scripting language wherein everycoin is protected by a program. An interpreter for the language evaluates the program against a context (a few variables containing information about a spending transaction and the blockchain), and produces a single boolean value as a result. While Bitcoin Script allows for some contracts to be programmed, its abilities are limited. Also, to add new cryptographic primitives, for example, ring signatures, a hard-fork is required.

Generalizing Bitcoin Script, the ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter implement an _authentication language_ which allows to express coin spending
conditions. The [ErgoScript Compiler](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/SigmaCompiler.scala#L48) compiles the source code into [ErgoTree](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/Values.scala#L990) byte code, which can be saved in UTXO coins to protect their spending (same as in Bitcoin).

ErgoTree, in turn, is a bytecode language and memory representation which can be deterministically interpreted in the given _blockchain context_. 
ErgoTree defines guarding proposition for a coin as a logic formula which combines predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via [Î£-protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge#Sigma_protocols) with AND, OR, k-out-of-n connectives.

## ErgoScript

> [ErgoScript, a Cryptocurrency Scripting Language Supporting Noninteractive Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf)

Learn [Ergoscript by reading example smart contracts](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) powered by the Ergo Playground. Each contract example includes a link which allows you to instantly edit and run the smart contract code inside of your browser.

If you ever need clarity about how specific types/functions/operators in ErgoScript work, please reference the [ErgoScript Language Description](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/docs/LangSpec.md). For an overarching summary, please reference this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l2v1asHgyA)

## Languages
### Scala

- [Sigmastate-Interpreter](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter) | The Sigmastate-Interpreter is a ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree Interpreter implementation for Ergo blockchain's *Sigma Language*  For development of Ergo applications using JVM languages a better alternative is to use [Appkit](#appkit).
- [ScoreX](https://github.com/scorexfoundation/scorex), the open-source, modular blockchain & cryptocurrency framework.
- [Scrypto](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto) | Scrypto is an open source cryptographic toolkit designed to make it easier and safer for developers to use cryptography in their applications based on Scorex

This library is used internally in [Ergo Node](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo) and [ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/ergo-wallet), the public interfaces are subject to change.

### Rust

[sigma-rust](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust)  is an alternative and simple implementation of ErgoTree interpreter and transaction building tools. The goal for the Rust version is to be on par with Scala version feature-wise. At the moment, the Rust version is still significantly behind. Also the goal for the Rust version is to have bindings for web, iOS and Android. The Scala version will continue to be the primary choice for JVM ecosystem with Rust version covering the rest. To get better understanding on how to use it in your project check see [Usage Examples](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust#usage-examples)

> A list of "*good first*" issues for Sigma-Rust is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - @greenhat on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q86PNMwRsu) is ready to assist anyone who is interested.

### JS/TS

 - [ergo-ts (TypeScript)](https://github.com/coinbarn/ergo-ts) with support of tokens and complex transactions
 - [ergo-js (JavaScript)](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-js) with basic transaction operations
 - [Ergo JS Template](https://github.com/anon-real/ergo-js-template)

### C#

There is a great video series by Razor-sharp Solution | [Ergo with C# 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUuki-fAxwc&list=PLUWruihtE-HtL-JZk8Vb4Yn_H18aE3rb6)

Stay tuned - A C# interpreter, cross-platform wallet, management and miner platform is in development!
