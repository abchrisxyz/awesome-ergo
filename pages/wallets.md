We highly recommend the use of wallets for storing Ergo assets (technically, they store the keys to your Ergo addresses). But keep in mind, your wallet is unlike your bank account, so take extra precautions with your passwords and be sure to perform regular backups to protect your money.

Note that wallets are supported by third parties, we only provide the information below as a courtesy, in order to simplify the overall digital currency experience for you.

Yoroi (on desktop) or a full node is the best solution at the moment. Mobile apps in development.

iOS wallet in development

## Ledger

Integration underway. Tesseract is moving onto the next stage of development, implementing the ledger specs. Things got a little delayed in the initial spec process. I hope to see the implementation with a very basic UI, at that point they will shift their focus into fully building out the user interface. After that it is test, test, test.

> 07/07 News from the Tesseract team: We've started the first actual coding milestone. Established project structure. Ledger communication is the current focus. The next step is an implementation of the protocol developed in the previous milestone.
