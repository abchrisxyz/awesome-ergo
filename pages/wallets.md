# Ledger

**Yoroi**

Currently being integrated into Yoroi. Check weekly development updates. 

> Working on ledgerjs-hw-app-ergo, an Ergo binding library for the Ledger API that will interact with Yoroi.


Integration underway. Tesseract is moving onto the next stage of development, implementing the ledger specs. Things got a little delayed in the initial spec process. I hope to see the implementation with a very basic UI, at that point they will shift their focus into fully building out the user interface. After that it is test, test, test.

**Waves.exchange**

You can load ERG onto Ledger with a workaround using [Waves.exchange (Ergo on Waves blockchain exchanged via trusted gateway)](https://waves.exchange/). (This will be wrapped erg, rather than native)
