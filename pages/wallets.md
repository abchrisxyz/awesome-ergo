# Ledger
> 13/10 - Currently being integrated into Yoroi. Check weekly development updates. "Working on ledgerjs-hw-app-ergo, an Ergo binding library for the Ledger API that will interact with Yoroi."


Integration underway. Tesseract is moving onto the next stage of development, implementing the ledger specs. Things got a little delayed in the initial spec process. I hope to see the implementation with a very basic UI, at that point they will shift their focus into fully building out the user interface. After that it is test, test, test.


You can load ERG onto Ledger with a workaround using [Waves.exchange (Ergo on Waves blockchain exchanged via trusted gateway)](https://waves.exchange/). (This will be wrapped erg, rather than native)
